- **🕸️ Neural Knowledge Graph**: Live Canvas-driven visualization of AI entity mapping and knowledge nodes.
- **📊 Global Elite Benchmarking**: Real-time performance comparison against world-class models (Claude vs. Gemini vs. Logi).
- **📝 Dynamic Intelligence Report**: Post-scan executive summaries with architectural integrity and security certification.
- **💓 Neural Pulse Ticker**: Floating real-time sentiment stream showing the live "thoughts" of the model swarm.
- **📂 Sticky Dependency Explorer**: Persistent tracking of critical project files at the top of the interface.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React + Vite (Next-Gen Performance)
- **Language**: TypeScript (Type-Safe Reliability)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (Premium Glassmorphism & Micro-animations)
- **Intelligence**: Multi-Model Orchestration (Logi Infinity Core)

## 🛠️ Development & Local Setup

```bash
# Install the Logi Intelligence dependencies
npm install

# Run the Logi Executive Dashboard
npm run dev

# Build for professional production
npm run build
```

## 🌐 Deployment (Vercel / Netlify)

This project is optimized for ultra-fast deployment on modern cloud platforms:

1. **GitHub**: Push your changes to your main branch.
2. **Vercel**: Connect your repository to Vercel. It will automatically detect the **Vite** configuration and use `npm run build` for deployment.
3. **Environment**: Ensure no environment variables are needed unless you integrate third-party APIs beyond the mock orchestration.
